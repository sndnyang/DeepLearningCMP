# DeepLearningCMP

Try PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Chainer, make them have same output as possible.

PyTorch == 0.4.1, Tensorflow-gpu == 1.12.0, Chainer == 5.2.0, Keras == ???

# Status

Now I have implemented PyTorch and Chainer. By setting a weight initializer to PyTorch model, I can have models created by PyTorch and Chainer to have same outputs for most layers(I can't figure Dropout layer out). 

I also had Keras implemented model by different versions of Keras.
